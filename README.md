==================

The web application searches for relevant images for yahoo news articles by analysing the content of the news feed
and generating concept keywords out of it. The keywords are then used to generate tags and flickr photos with
title,description and tags matching our keyowords are returned. The app returns the 10 most relevant images it 
manages to find.

The chrome extension tries to embed the most relevant image directly into the yahoo news article at the placeholder
for related content for news item.
